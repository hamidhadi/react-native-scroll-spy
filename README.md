# react-native-scroll-spy
I'm trying to build something like scroll spy on the web with react-native section list.

As you can see in the demo there is an issue on scrolling that causing scroll jumping.
<br>If you can help me to fix this issue please join [this discussion](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22809) or answer [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53964303/after-calling-scrolltolocation-method-of-sectionlist-scroll-is-jumping) on StackOverflow.
